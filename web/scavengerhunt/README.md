## Solution
This really is just a scavenger hunt without requiring any hacking.  You just need to know some places to look and see if you can find a piece of the flag.

### First
It is right there on the front page.  Easy.

### Second
Now I open up the Chrome developer tools to examine the source code for the website and find the second flag.

### Third
This was actually the last one that I found.  The organizers announced a hint of "Beep Boop Bop".  Sounds like a robot right?  Well all sites (or they should) have a robots.txt file.  This file is used as an instruction to search engines how they should index for searching this website.  I don't really care too much about that aspect right now but this file does contain our third flag.

### Fourth
Still with the developer tools open we look as the JavaScript file script1.js and find our fourth flag.

Still with the developer tools open we look as the JavaScript file script2.js and find our fifth flag.

Challenge Complete!
